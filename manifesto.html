      <h2>It’s All a Scam</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s not pretend the system is broken. It’s not. It works exactly as intended. It was built to funnel value upward. It extracts. It siphons. It punishes labor and rewards leverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you budget for groceries, central banks print trillions out of thin air to prop up dying institutions. When you miss a payment, you’re charged a fee. When banks go insolvent, they get bailed out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2008 crash wiped out <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.html" target="_blank">entire communities</a>. Nobody went to prison. Executives got bonuses. You know that already. What you might not know is that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikecollins/2015/07/14/the-true-cost-of-the-bank-bailout/?sh=6f5d3a5614e6" target="_blank">over $16 trillion</a> was handed out by the Federal Reserve to banks and corporations... interest-free.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Who Pays?</h2>
      <p>
        You do. Every time your rent goes up. Every time your wages stagnate while asset prices soar. Every time inflation eats into your savings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 1971, when the US left the gold standard, the dollar has lost over <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/" target="_blank">85% of its purchasing power</a>. Wages have flatlined, but housing, healthcare, and education have exploded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the top 1% now own more wealth than the entire middle class combined (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/" target="_blank">source</a>).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>What They Don't Teach You</h2>
      <p>
        They don’t teach you how money works. They don’t teach you about interest rate arbitrage, credit stacking, LLC shell games, or how bankruptcy resets your slate.
      </p>
      <p>
        They teach you to save. To obey. To play fair. While insiders lever up and extract yield off your compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reality is this: the wealthy do not play by the rules. They <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax" target="_blank">pay no taxes</a>. They borrow against their own inflated assets. They “default strategically” and walk away clean.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Tools Are There</h2>
      <p>
        You are allowed to open a business. You are allowed to access business credit. You are allowed to stack zero percent credit cards. You are allowed to borrow against assets. They just don’t advertise it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can borrow fake fiat and convert it into real crypto. Unseizable. Censorship-resistant. Stored on a wallet nobody can touch.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the coins go up, you win. If they don’t, you disappear. You declare bankruptcy. You settle. You negotiate. Welcome to the game.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>This Isn’t New</h2>
      <p>
        Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/us/politics/donald-trump-atlantic-city.html" target="_blank">declared bankruptcy six times</a>. Billion-dollar companies walk away from loans and leases routinely. In 2023, over 20 major corporations filed for bankruptcy to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/21/retail-bankruptcies-2023.html" target="_blank">escape liabilities</a> and restructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        They don’t fear consequences because they wrote the playbook.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Exit</h2>
      <p>
        This is not about fraud. This is about survival. This is about using the same tools the elite use and refusing to stay chained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crypto is not an investment. It is an exit. An exit from systems that were never meant to serve you.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you borrow to buy crypto, you are not just speculating. You are opting out. You are front-running inflation. You are leveraging a temporary credit score to acquire permanent assets.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>But Is It Right?</h2>
      <p>
        They built a system where the average person is crushed by student loans and rising rents while the rich gamble with zero downside. If you think obeying those rules makes you moral, they’ve already won.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are not obligated to play fair in a game rigged against you.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Final Note</h2>
      <p>
        This is not financial advice. This is a war manual. Learn the rules. Exploit the flaws. Exit the game.
