      <h2>The Premise</h2>
      <p>
        The financial system is designed to keep you obedient. Wages are taxed. Debt is forever. Inflation eats what little savings you manage to keep. You are not meant to win.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the system leaks. And it can be turned against itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the rich borrow money to buy assets, why can't you? If default is an option for them, it should be an option for you. The difference is they know the rules. You were never taught them.

      <h2>1. Getting Access to Capital</h2>
      <p>
        No wealth? No problem. Here's how to access funds without having any.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>0% APR Credit Cards:</b> Use comparison tools like <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/0-apr" target="_blank">NerdWallet 0% Offers</a> (US) or <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/best-0-credit-cards/" target="_blank">MSE Credit Cards</a> (UK). Withdraw to cash via Venmo or P2P crypto desks if exchanges block credit cards.</li>
        <li><b>Business Credit:</b> Open a sole proprietorship or LLC. Apply for cards from Stripe, Brex, Amex Business, or Capital on Tap (UK). Some do not check personal credit reports if you list >$10k annual revenue.</li>
        <li><b>BNPL:</b> Platforms like Klarna, Zip, and Affirm offer interest-free installment plans. Combine multiple to fund larger purchases. Some platforms issue virtual cards accepted on exchanges like Binance or Coinbase.</li>
        <li><b>Overdrafts & Personal Loans:</b> Stack lines across banks. Use services like Monzo or Revolut (UK) or Chime (US) for fast approvals. Spread applications to avoid hard pull clustering.</li>
        <li><b>Crypto-Backed Loans:</b> Borrow stables against ETH or BTC on <a href="https://app.aave.com" target="_blank">Aave</a>, <a href="https://app.makerdao.com" target="_blank">Maker</a>, or <a href="https://venus.io" target="_blank">Venus</a>. Be careful with liquidation risk.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>2. Keeping It Quiet</h2>
      <p>
        Use P2P cash buys on <a href="https://paxful.com" target="_blank">Paxful</a> or <a href="https://localmonero.co" target="_blank">LocalMonero</a>. Use self-custody wallets. Avoid exchanges that require KYC for off-ramping.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are dealing with borrowed funds, never leave assets on platforms with counterparty risk. Use hardware wallets. Never co-mingle wallets used to repay debt with wallets used to hold the actual bag.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>3. And If It All Goes to Zero?</h2>
      <p>
        Learn how bankruptcy works. In the US, unsecured credit card debt can be discharged via Chapter 7. In the UK, you may qualify for a Debt Relief Order or IVA.

        Most people never recover from debt because they try to play fair. Corporations don’t. You can choose not to.

      <h2>4. The Endgame</h2>
      <p>
        The point is not to be reckless. The point is to stop being predictable. If fiat dies, your debt dies. If crypto succeeds, you win. If neither happens, you can still vanish and rebuild.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your credit score is not your identity. Your wallet is.
